# TimestampIt reference scripts

This is a collection of scripts and programs in various languages for creating and verifying
Trusted Timestamps on https://www.timestampit.com.

## Organization

Scripts are organized into folders named based on their language or utility.

There are two basic operations involving Trusted Timestamps: Creation and Verification. Therefore, each folder generally contains two scripts: one for creating Trusted Timestamps, and another for verifying them.

## Usage

Generally, each script can be run without any arguments to get a usage statement.
```
$ ./rb/create.rb
Usage: ./rb/create.rb [options] <file to timestamp> <username> <password>
```

## Take this code and build awesome things!

We encourage building new applications that make use of Trusted Timestamps. Consider this code your starting point for your clients!
