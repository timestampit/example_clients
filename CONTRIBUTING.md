## Code contributions

This repository is intended to provide canonical example scripts/programs for creating and verifying Trusted Timestamps using timestampit.com. This repository does not offer libraries/packages.

Any pull request that improves upon the scripts that are already offered in this repo, whether the improvement is large or small, should be accepted.

Pull requests that add high quality working example code for languages that are not currently available should be accepted.

Contributions that deal with other kinds of Trusted Timestamps will not be accepted.

Contributions that add unnecessary dependencies will generally not be accepted.

All contributions are subject to code review and testing. We kindly ask for patience as this project is currently operating with limited resources.

## Client libraries for timestampit.com

We would love to see an ecosystem with high quality libraries/packages available in many languages. However such projects should be created in new repositories. We are happy to offer support, please email info@timestampit.com if support is desired. You may also tag @timestampit-official for code reviews relating to timestampit.com in other repositories.
